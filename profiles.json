As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) , his practice is grounded in a relational framework that explicitly incorporates anti-racist and LGBTQIA+ affirming methodologies. This positioning is critical for data matching algorithms designed to serve marginalized communities. Economically, his standard rate is set at $150, which serves as the baseline for fully licensed staff at this practice. His acceptance of major insurance plans (United, Aetna, BCBS) combined with a willingness to provide superbills for OON clients makes him a high-accessibility node in the network. His background in education prior to therapy suggests a specific aptitude for working with adolescents and young adults, a demographic often seeking \"relatable\" authority figures."

Her sliding scale availability is a key economic data point for long-term grief work which may exhaust standard insurance benefits."
